And that’s not counting the calculation of the weights to be lifted for warm up. In the end, it’s not that complicated, but it can be made easier with Shiny!\nhttps://github.com/ThelmaPana/weightR\n\n\n\nAccurate representation of me and my big Kermit legs on my bike."

You have to take into account the water and fertiliser requirements of each plant, as well as the season. To make my job easier, I’ve created this app, which gives me a daily list of plants to water. I declare in the app which plants I’ve actually watered (some may only need watering in a day or two), and it updates the database, including the last watering date, so that the next watering date is computed. The same goes for fertiliser.\nIt’s certainly not coded in the best possible way, but it works, and my plants are happy!\nThe code is here: https://github.com/ThelmaPana/happy_plants"

    "text": "I am a recent PhD graduate from the Laboratoire d’Océanographie de Villefranche (France). I develop and apply machine learning tools to study large plankton datasets in order to investigate its distribution at various scales.\nOverall, I like applying computational tools to solve practical problems, and not only in my professional life. I really enjoy coding, thinking about how to turn a problem around so that it can be solved with numerical tools, and learning new numerical skills!\n\nOutside of the work place, I enjoy a wide range of sporting activities. I mainly ride my road bike (long live bike commuting!), I also regularly do weight training and a little less regularly run. I’ve also recently taken up triathlon, but I have to say that swimming isn’t my strong point, so at least that leaves me plenty of room for improvement! Finally, I’m lucky enough to live in a magnificent region that offers many hiking routes.\nI also practiced roller derby for 3 years, first with the Western Australia Roller Derby, in Perth, and then in Nice with the Nice Roller Derby.\nBefore that, I was a scuba diver for 18 years (I started when I was 7), and I also did some freediving, which I plan to take up again one day."
