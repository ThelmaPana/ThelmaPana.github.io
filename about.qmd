![](about_me.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

I am a recent PhD graduate from the Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie de Villefranche (France). I develop and apply machine learning tools to study large plankton datasets in order to investigate its distribution at various scales.

Overall, I like applying computational tools to solve practical problems, and not only in my professional life. I really enjoy coding, thinking about how to turn a problem around so that it can be solved with numerical tools, and learning new numerical skills!

Outside of the work place, I enjoy a wide range of sporting activities. I mainly ride my road bike (long live bike commuting!), I also regularly do weight training and a little less regularly run. I also take advantage of the LOV's exceptional location to regularly take a dip in the Mediterranean Sea and perhaps someday improve my swimming skills, with the hope of one day completing a triathlon. I'm also lucky enough to live in a magnificent region that offers many hiking routes.

I also practiced roller derby for 3 years, first with the Western Australia Roller Derby, in Perth, and then in Nice with the Nice Roller Derby.

Before that, I was a scuba diver for 18 years (I started when I was 7), and I also did some freediving, which I plan to take up again one day.
