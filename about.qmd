I completed my PhD in 2023 at the Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie de Villefranche (LOV) in south of France. The core of my work is to develop and apply machine learning tools to study large (plankton) datasets.

Overall, I like applying computational tools to solve practical problems, and not only in my professional life. I really enjoy coding, thinking about how to turn a problem around so that it can be solved with numerical tools, and learning new numerical skills!

Outside of the work place, I enjoy a wide range of sporting activities. I mainly ride my road bike (long live bike commuting, even in Southampton), I also regularly do weight training and a little less regularly run. I've also recently taken up triathlon, but I have to say that swimming isn't my strong point, so at least that leaves me plenty of room for improvement!

I also practiced roller derby for 3 years, first with the Western Australia Roller Derby, in Perth, and then in Nice with the Nice Roller Derby.

Before that, I was a scuba diver for 18 years (I started when I was 7), and I also did some freediving, which I plan to take up again one day.
