− I’m going for a ride!

− How long is it gonna take?

− Hum, not sure… 3 hours I guess

…

\*Proceeds to come home 4 hours later, didn’t think it was so hilly.\*

Well, this will not happen anymore: enters RideR, a shiny app to predict the time of your future ride, based on distance and elevation and how you did in your previous rides.

Basically, it is based on a XGBoost model trained with previous rides data, including distance, elevation and time on the bike. For now, it does not perform amazingly well, because I only had a few dozens of training elements (i.e. rides). There is only one way to remedy this: saddle up!
