This is the code supporting my paper "Three mesoplanktonic worlds resolved by *in situ* imaging in the upper 500 m of the global ocean", currently under review in Global Ecology and Biogeography.

It consists of data extraction, a lot of data processing/cleaning, a few multivariate analyses and nice visualisations.
