This is the code supporting my paper on plankton communities seen by in situ imaging.

**T Panaïotis**, M Babin, T Biard, F Carlotti, L Coppola, L Guidi, H Hauss, L Karp-Boss, R Kiko, F Lombard, AMP McDonnell, M Picheral, A Rogge, AM Waite, L Stemmann and JO Irisson (2023). Three major mesoplanktonic communities resolved by in situ imaging in the upper 500 m of the global ocean. *Global Ecology and Biogeography*. [10.1111/geb.13741](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13741)

It consists of data extraction, a lot of data processing/cleaning, a few multivariate analyses and nice visualisations.
