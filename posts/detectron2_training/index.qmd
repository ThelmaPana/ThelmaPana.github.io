This is the code to train the CNN-based detector [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) on [ISIIS](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2008.6.126) images.

The trained model is then used in [apeep](https://github.com/jiho/apeep) to detect planktonic organisms in ISIIS images. This is part of the work on the segmentation of plankton images published in Frontiers in Marine Science: [10.3389/fmars.2022.870005](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.870005).
