This repository contains code to compare three segmentation pipelines applied to [ISIIS](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2008.6.126) images, against a ground-truth segmentation generated by a human operator.

The results of this comparison are published in Frontiers in Marine Science: [10.3389/fmars.2022.870005](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.870005). The [war machine](https://github.com/jiho/apeep) we have developed -- based on a CNN detector -- generates the best results, but it processes data with the slowness of a tank.
