Here's a map of my wanderings on land and sea (since January 2022), including cycling, running, hiking and swimming (but excluding bike commuting!)

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(sf)

# Read data
lines_sf <- read_sf("garmin/activities.geojson")

# Define colour for each activity
colours <- tribble(
  ~activity, ~colour,
  "road cycling", "#f03b20",

  "walking", "#78c679",
  "open water swimming", "#3376BD",

)

# Base map
map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldTopoMap") %>% 
  setView(lng = 0, lat = 47, zoom = 5)

# Add lines for each type of activity
activity_types <- sort(unique(lines_sf$activity))

for (type in activity_types){
  colour_type <- colours %>% filter(activity == type) %>% pull(colour)
  lines_sf_type <- lines_sf %>% filter(activity == type)
  
  map <- map %>% 
    addPolylines(
      data = lines_sf_type,
      color = colour_type,
      opacity = 0.9
      )
}

# Add legend
map <- map %>% 
  addLegend(
    "topright", 
    colors = colours$colour,
    labels = colours$activity,
    opacity = 1
    )

# Return map
